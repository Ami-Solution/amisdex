voBits is an Ethereum Token Decentralized exchange community with the most ERC20 listings of any exchange, and including new tokens from airdrops/bounties/ICOs with liquidity support from its community.


# What is voBits?
voBits currently acts as an updated (new features), open source and updated interface for EtherDelta's smart contract with an active and public development. Although voBits is a decendant of  EtherDelta (ForkDelta), considerable development time has been put towards it.

The purpose of voBits is to have a community driven token ecosystem that is self funded by its community, upholding the dreams of its founders and be a community home to all ETHEREUM BASED TOKEN  that have potential with potentails to add value to the human race. It is agaisnt scam since it is backed in GitHub (no domain spoofing like occured in EtherDelta).


# How does voBits Work?
voBits currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract (described in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6kdiyl/smart_contract_overview/)) which allows voBits users to trade utilizing its volume. But soon we will migrate to our own smart contract.


# Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community since its powered by the ethereum tokenized community. You can contribute by improving the code, documentation, or by donating to its  development voluntary.
