# What is voBits?
voBits is an Ethereum Token Decentralized exchange community with ERC20/233 support, and including new tokens from airdrops/bounties/ICOs with liquidity support from its community via mining.


The purpose of voBits is to have a community driven token ecosystem that is self funded by its community, upholding the dreams of its founders and be a community home to all ETHEREUM BASED TOKEN that have potential with potentials to add value to the human race. It is against scam since because it is backed in GitHub (no domain spoofing).


# How does voBits Work?
voBits currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract (described in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6kdiyl/smart_contract_overview/)) which allows voBits users to trade utilizing its volume. But soon we will migrate to our own  voBitsExchange wallet smart contract which will  have more function and ability to purchase ether directly while on the decentralized trading platform using integrated payment gateway for transaction.
